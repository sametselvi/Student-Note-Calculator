# Student-Note-Calculator


This program can calculate students' grades. This system also includes verbal grades.
Verbal grade can take the proportion of 20 percent and the proportion of written lesson scores is considered as 80 percent.

For example, one student's math score is 90 and their verbal grade is 70. 
90 *0.80 + 70 *0.20= Average Score
